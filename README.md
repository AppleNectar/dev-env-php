# Docker environment for PHP application

Docker container stack for a web service development using PHP.  
The stack consists of Nginx / php-fpm / MySQL / Redis, each container is based on Debian.  
It also includes an Apache (with mod_php) container, so you can use Apache by changing the configuration.  
It's only for local development, please don't use it in a server environment (EC2, ECS, etc).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Rename .env.example to .env and refer to the comment to set the value.
3. Create the app directory at the same level as the build directory.( `app` is mounted as `/var/www/html/app` )  
Do you want to change the document root under `app` directory?  
In that case, copy `/docker/web/conf/default.conf` to any location in your project directory, change the `root` directive, and bind-mount it as `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`.
4. Execute the `docker compose up -d` command.
5. Create an `index.php` file and put `<?php phpinfo();` to file in the `app` directory of your project root, and access `http://localhost:8080` from your browser!
6. Let's develop it freely!ðŸ˜Ž
